For many years I've been wanting to have my own personal portfolio/blog website but every time I got a burst of inspiration nothing has ever come out of it.
When I've tried in the past I always found it fun for the first couple of hours but then lose all motivation to continue on it because I try to make it too good by following all the best practices and whatnot, which makes it too hard and not any fun.
This is a reoccurring pattern for all my side projects so far which has contributed to me not feeling like I've had any content to put on the website, which has meant that all the content has just been _lorem ipsum_ placeholders, which in turn has made me not care about the site since it hasn't been any part of "me" in it.

However, I recently read [_How to Make a Damn Website_](https://lmnt.me/blog/how-to-make-a-damn-website.html) by Louie Mantia and in the first paragraph he writes,

> It’s easy to forget how simple a website can be. A website can be just one page. It doesn’t even need CSS. You don’t need a content management system like Wordpress. All you have to do is write some HTML and drag that file to a server over FTP.

After reading the post I had a sudden realization that I should only care about putting out something that's not placeholder content and figure out the rest later.
If you're even remotely interested in making content on the internet I can recommend reading the full post.

So what's the plan for this blog?
To start out I'll probably just be writing about what I find interesting at the moment, most of it (probably all if I'm being honest with myself) will be technology and software focused.
There probably won't be anything revolutionary posted here, but my hope is that it might be useful or at least a bit interesting to someone.
With that said I don't really expect anyone to be reading any of this, but if you are, I hope you enjoying it.

So this is me just doing it, putting myself out there on the World Wide Web without any real clue of how to write or what to do next.
