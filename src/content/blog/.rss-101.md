Really Simple Syndication, or RSS, is something that I've seen all around the web but until recently I haven't really understood how it works.
However, since it's something which the people who are using is seem to swear by and since I'm now in the blogging business, it is one probably something I should at the very least investigate.

RSS is actually really simple (no pun intended), in essence it's just a textfile containing some basic metadata about the content of the feed it's representing, all through a simple textfile.

If I, a consumer, want to know what's new on a website I just download the `rss.xml` (or ``)

Below is an example of the RSS feed for the posts on this site.

- RSS Aggregator
- Versions
- Usage - News, Podcasts, Calendars
